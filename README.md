This repo contains solution to problem statement given by recruitment team of EI in their campus hiring program.

**Problem Statement**
Create a simple To-Do List Manager where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them. The user should also have the option to view all tasks or filter them based on their completion status.

**Functional Requirements**
1. Enable users to add new tasks with a description and due date.
2. Allow tasks to be marked as 'completed'.
3. Provide an option to delete tasks.
4. Implement the ability to view tasks, either all at once or filtered by 'completed' or 'pending'.

   
**Key Focus**
1. Behavioral Pattern: Use the Memento Pattern to allow the user to undo or redo actions.
2. Creational Pattern: Use the Builder Pattern for constructing tasks with optional attributes like due date or tags.
3. OOP: Focus on encapsulation by keeping task data and methods together in a class.

NOTE: In the above program, Index of lists are assumed to start from 0.
